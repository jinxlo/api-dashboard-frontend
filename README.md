# Atlas AI Platform

Atlas AI Platform is a secure multi-tenant developer dashboard for provisioning and managing access to a large language model. It provides self-service account creation, API key management powered by Kong Gateway, a chat-style playground, and profile controls built on Next.js 15.

## Features

- üîê Authentication with NextAuth.js credentials provider and Prisma adapter
- üîë API key lifecycle management integrated with the Kong Admin API, including model-scoped keys
- üí¨ Multi-modal playground covering language, text-to-speech, and text-to-image previews
- üë§ Profile and password management with inline validation and graceful demo-mode messaging
- üìä Redesigned dashboard with environment overview, model catalogue, and key analytics

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js 15 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) inspired component primitives

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database instance
- Kong Gateway with admin API access

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/aiplatform?schema=public"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="generate-a-secure-secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_KONG_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
KONG_ADMIN_API_URL="http://localhost:8001"
KONG_PLAYGROUND_KEY="replace-with-eval-api-key"
# Optional overrides for the demo login
# DEMO_USER_EMAIL="demo@atlas.ai"
# DEMO_USER_PASSWORD="AtlasDemo!2025"
# DEMO_USER_PASSWORD_HASH=""
# DEMO_USER_NAME="Atlas Demo"
# DEMO_USER_ID="demo-user"
```

## Database

Run the Prisma migrations to create the authentication schema (required for account creation and profile editing):

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Seed the demo login (defaults to `demo@atlas.ai` / `AtlasDemo!2025` unless `DEMO_USER_*` variables are supplied):

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

If you are in an offline environment you can bypass engine checksum checks with `PRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING=1`.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the application. Create an account via the sign up page, then access the dashboard, playground, and settings areas.

The seeded demo credentials (`demo@atlas.ai` / `AtlasDemo!2025`) are always available after `npm run db:seed` unless you override them with `DEMO_USER_*` values.

If a database connection is not configured (for example in preview deployments), the application automatically falls back to the demo credentials so you can still explore the experience. Settings will surface deployment instructions until the database connection is in place. Set `DEMO_USER_PASSWORD_HASH` if you prefer to keep the password value private‚Äîwhen present the login form will prompt users to obtain the password from the environment instead of displaying it inline.

## Kong Integration

The application expects Kong to manage API keys via the Key Authentication plugin. The `/api/keys` API route will:

1. Ensure a consumer exists for the logged-in user (using the user ID as `custom_id`).
2. Create new key credentials via `POST /consumers/{consumer}/key-auth`.
3. Tag each key with the selected model scopes (`model:{id}`) so the dashboard can display access levels.

Revoking a key issues `DELETE /consumers/{consumer}/key-auth/{keyId}`. The dashboard lists available keys by calling the Kong Admin API. When `KONG_ADMIN_API_URL` is not present (for example in local demos) the application falls back to a filesystem-backed store under `.data/demo-api-keys.json` so you can still exercise the UI without external dependencies.

## Testing the Playground

- `/api/playground/chat` proxies requests to the language models using `KONG_PLAYGROUND_KEY` when configured and returns explanatory responses otherwise.
- `/api/playground/tts` generates synthetic audio previews so you can validate the UI before wiring in a production speech endpoint.
- `/api/playground/image` produces branded SVG placeholders to illustrate prompt outputs without invoking a real diffusion service.

## Security Considerations

- Full API keys are never stored in the application database.
- All protected routes, including API endpoints, are guarded by NextAuth middleware.
- Passwords are hashed with `bcrypt` before persistence.

## Deploying on Vercel

1. **Provision a Postgres database** ‚Äì add the [Vercel Postgres integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/vercel-postgres) or connect an external provider such as Neon. Copy the generated `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL`, `POSTGRES_URL`, and `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` secrets.
2. **Configure environment variables** ‚Äì in the Vercel dashboard set the following for your project:
   - `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` (or `DATABASE_URL`) pointing at the production database.
   - `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` for local CLI access (optional but recommended).
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` equal to your deployment URL (for example `https://your-app.vercel.app`).
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (optional). If omitted, the application will derive a deterministic secret, but providing one lets you rotate credentials manually.
   - `KONG_ADMIN_API_URL`, `KONG_PLAYGROUND_KEY`, and any `DEMO_USER_*` overrides you need.
3. **Run migrations against the hosted database** ‚Äì pull the Vercel environment locally and execute the migrations:
   ```bash
   vercel env pull .env.production.local
   DATABASE_URL=$(grep DATABASE_URL .env.production.local | cut -d'=' -f2-) npx prisma migrate deploy
   DATABASE_URL=$(grep DATABASE_URL .env.production.local | cut -d'=' -f2-) npm run db:seed
   ```
   Alternatively, use the `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` value directly when running the commands.
4. **Deploy** ‚Äì once the database is migrated and seeded, trigger `vercel deploy`. The existing build command (`npm run build`) already runs `prisma generate` so the Prisma Client stays in sync with cached installs.

After deployment you can sign in with the seeded demo credentials and update the password from the in-app settings page.
